## Project Overview

This project analyzes GDP data for 2000â€“2015 from the World Bank to uncover economic trends and forecast future values. The dataset includes GDP in current US dollars for countries globally. We explore growth patterns, regional differences, and build a model to predict 2016 GDP values.

Key questions:
- Who grew the most?
- Who struggled during crises?
- What does the future look like?
